    <b style="font-size: 1.0rem;">THE MYTH OF “RISING ABOVE”</b> <br><br><br>


    There’s a story we cling to, a comforting myth about healing - that it means “rising above” our vulnerable human hearts.<br><br>
    
    That spiritual awakening is some kind of “shedding” of our humanity, and a realm of untouchable stillness. But this story is a lie.<br><br>
    
    Peace is not the absence of feeling. <br><br>
    
    Strength is not the absence of trembling.<br><br>
    
    In our rush to transcend, we silence our anger in the name of kindness, mask our grief with spiritual smiles. <br><br>
    
    We dismiss our fear as illusion, our wounded hearts as the ego’s noise. And we call it all love. <br><br>
    
    We follow gurus who claim to have ended suffering. Lost their egos. Transcended their pain. <br><br>
    
    “I never get angry”, they say. <br><br>
    
    “I only have loving thoughts”.<br><br>
    
    “My ego vanished in 1964”. <br><br>
    
    In chasing enlightenment like this, we abandon the messy truth of our own aliveness. But what we suppress does not disappear. <br><br>
    
    It lodges within us, in the ache of our chests, the tension in our shoulders, the restless beat of our hearts. <br><br>
    
    The shadows we deny grow louder and darker. The pain we avoid festers in the deep.<br><br>
    
    Neuroscience tells us that chronically suppressing our emotions activates a stress response, flooding our bodies with cortisol, inflammation, fear. <br><br>
    
    Over time this can weaken our immune system, disrupt our sleep, and increase the risk of all kinds of illness. The body remembers what the mind tries to forget. <br><br>
    
    True healing is not an escape from this mess of earth and sweat and trembling, but the courage to step into it all. Not a rising above, but a rooting down.<br><br>
    
    To touch the fire of grief. To liberate the roar of anger. To stand in the trembling truth: <br><br>
    
    I am not okay, and it is so damn okay. <br><br>
    
    Healing is the painful sob that cracks you open, the soft rain on your face in the early morning, the earth beneath your knees when you fall. <br><br>
    
    Healing is the raw, holy ache of being alive. <br><br>
    
    You are not broken for feeling life so deeply, friend. Your sorrow, your fear, your shame - they are not mistakes. <br><br>
    
    These are invitations from God. To awaken is not to transcend, but to descend, consciously, into the depths you once decided you could not bear.<br><br>
    
    And yes, the descent may shatter your old illusions. Your old life. <br><br>
    
    But beyond the breaking lies a strength you have not lost, a wholeness that comes not from escaping pain, but from holding it so close. <br><br>
    
    No more pretending. <br><br>
    
    No more forced smiles.<br><br>
    
    Let the anger rise. <br><br>
    
    Let the tears fall.<br><br>
    
    Let your pain soften you, until it cracks you open to grace.<br><br>
    
    Let your trembling truth speak at last.<br><br>
    
    This is what it means to be fully, fiercely alive.<br><br><br>
