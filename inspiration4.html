MYSTICAL ASCENSION IN PRAYER</b>
        
      

<i>Matthew 7:7 

Ask, and it shall be given you; 

seek, and ye shall find; 

knock, and it shall be opened unto you: 

For every one that asketh receiveth; 

and he that seeketh findeth; 

and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. </i>




What if Jesus was never Christian, 

nor a mere teacher of religious doctrine, 

but a Mystic Adept 

who understood the hidden architecture of existence? 



What if his words were not calls to dogma 

and fundamentalism, 

but hidden keys 

to unlocking the quantum realities of the soul?



When Jesus said, 

"Ask, and it shall be given unto you; 

seek, and you shall find; 

knock, and the door shall be opened to you," 


He was not spreading religion or promising earthly rewards. 



He was unveiling a mystical law

—a hidden principle of reality 

that governs the movement of consciousness 

through dimensional timelines within our being. 



He was revealing the hidden mechanics of existence, 

the cosmic law 

by which the soul unfolds 

through dimensional ascension.



These words were not mere teachings, 

but vibrational codes, 

encrypted with infinite possibilities, 

waiting to be activated 

by those who could perceive their true meaning.



Jesus did not come to establish Christian fundamentalism 

or to bind souls within the egregore of religion 

as many believe and teach 

but to awaken the soul to its own divine agency, 

revealing the mechanics of manifestation 

and ascension. 



His words carried the resonance 

of those who walk between higher worlds, 

those who understand that reality is not fixed 

but woven from the strands of Non-duality.



To ask was to attune one's discovery, 

aligning with the vibrational currents of creation, 

unseen forces that shape existence.



To seek was to traverse the hidden pathways of being, 

unfolding into one’s true entropic self, 

dissolving illusions 

and becoming 

through the Akashic Records

—the living archive of all that has been, 

is, 

and will be.



To knock was to shift the very fabric of reality, 

transcending linear existence 

and stepping into the mastery of beingness 

into the fullness of our Sovereign Godhood

—the divine state beyond illusion.



These were not teachings of faith 

but keys of mystical alchemy, 

guiding the initiate 

toward their divine remembrance. 



Jesus was not a gatekeeper of religion 

but a way-shower of cosmic dominance 

of kings.



These were not mere words 

but vibrational keys, 

unlocking the dimensional timelines 

encoded within our essence. 



Jesus did not come 

to bind souls to religious doctrine 

but to liberate them, 

teaching the art of mystical ascension

—where reality is not something to obey, 

but something to master.



His prayers were not pleas, 

but mystical incantations

—sonic frequencies 

that resonated with the higher laws of manifestation. 



He did not seek to spread a religion, 

but to awaken souls 

to the hidden mechanics of creation, 

to teach them how to step 

beyond the illusion of fixed reality 

and into the multiversal ascension of being.



His prayers were not mere words, 

but sonic keys

—vibrational codes t

hat attuned the seeker 

to higher realms of existence. 



He spoke in mystical parables, 

not to conceal the truth, 

but to reveal it 

to those with the spiritual sight 

to perceive.



Was Jesus an Ascended Master of the Great Mysteries, 

guiding humanity toward its divine inheritance?



Have you ever questioned why 

the fundamentalist prayers of Christians 

fail to open the dimensional gateways 

of Jesus’ mystical experiences

—the very experiences they claim to follow 

as their archetype?


The answer lies in the nature of prayer itself 

cum its dimensional functional consciousness. 



Jesus prayers was transcendence 

and Religion is dualistic veiled prayers.



Jesus’ prayer was not a plea 

to an external deity, 

nor a ritual bound by fundamentalism. 



It was a transcendent state of being, 

an attunement to the field of non-duality, 

where one becomes aware 

of his sovereign self 

of IAM.



In contrast, 

religious prayers are veiled in duality

—rooted in separation, 

pleading to an externalized God 

rather than realizing their 

God-self vibrational cord of relation. 



These prayers operate 

within the egregore of limitation, 

reinforcing the illusion 

in the liberties of access 

in the realms of Glory.



To pray as Jesus prayed 

is not to utter words 

in blind faith, 

nor to plead 

for divine intervention. 


It is 

to step into 

the truth of transcendence

—the realization 

of our Sovereign Godhood 

of IAM, 

Sole Creator 

of all reality 

and existence.


Jesus did not pray 

from separation, 

nor did he beg the heavens 

for miracles. 


He was the Creator

—the living embodiment 

of divine kingship, 

wielding the fullness 

of dominion 

to mobilize 

the realms 

of greater creation. 


His prayer 

was not dualistic, 

but unified

—not a request, 

but a resonance 

of Higher Glory, 

an invocation 

of his own cosmic authority 

to administer reality itself.



This is the Law of Kingship

—the principle 

by which creators move 

as Sovereign Architects 

of Existence, 

shaping reality 

through the sheer force 

of IAM.



Jesus did not pray 

from separation, 

nor did he beg the heavens 

for miracles. 


He was God embodiment 

of the fullness dominance 

of kingship 

to mobilize realm 

of greater creation. 


His prayer 

was not dualistic, 

but unified

—not a request, 

but a resonance 

of his Glory to administer creation.



To pray 

as he prayed 

is to attune to the law 

of IAMBeingness, 

where manifestation 

is not a plea, 

but dissolution 

into our IAM Essence. 



It is to stand 

in the I AM, 

where divinity 

is not granted

—it is remembered.



Religion prays 

in veils, 

limitations.



Transcendence prays 

in Self realization 

of their IAM Self.
