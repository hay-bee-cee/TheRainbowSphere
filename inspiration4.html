MYSTICAL ASCENSION IN PRAYER</b> <br><br><br>    

<i>Matthew 7:7 <br><br>

Ask, and it shall be given you; <br><br>

seek, and ye shall find; <br><br>

knock, and it shall be opened unto you: <br><br>

For every one that asketh receiveth; <br><br>

and he that seeketh findeth; <br><br>

and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. </i> <br><br> <br>




What if Jesus was never Christian, nor a mere teacher of religious doctrine, but a Mystic Adept who understood the hidden architecture of existence?<br><br> 

What if his words were not calls to dogma and fundamentalism, but hidden keys to unlocking the quantum realities of the soul? <br><br>

When Jesus said, "Ask, and it shall be given unto you; seek, and you shall find; knock, and the door shall be opened to you," He was not spreading religion or promising earthly rewards. <br><br>

He was unveiling a mystical law — a hidden principle of reality that governs the movement of consciousness through dimensional timelines within our being. <br><br>

He was revealing the hidden mechanics of existence, the cosmic law by which the soul unfolds through dimensional ascension. <br><br>

These words were not mere teachings, but vibrational codes, encrypted with infinite possibilities, waiting to be activated by those who could perceive their true meaning. <br><br>

Jesus did not come to establish Christian fundamentalism or to bind souls within the egregore of religion as many believe and teach but to awaken the soul to its own divine agency, revealing the mechanics of manifestation and ascension. <br><br>

His words carried the resonance of those who walk between higher worlds, those who understand that reality is not fixed but woven from the strands of Non-duality.<br><br>

To ask was to attune one's discovery, aligning with the vibrational currents of creation, unseen forces that shape existence.<br><br>

To seek was to traverse the hidden pathways of being, unfolding into one’s true entropic self, dissolving illusions and becoming through the Akashic Records—the living archive of all that has been, is, and will be.<br><br>

To knock was to shift the very fabric of reality, transcending linear existence and stepping into the mastery of beingness into the fullness of our Sovereign Godhood — the divine state beyond illusion.<br><br>

These were not teachings of faith but keys of mystical alchemy, guiding the initiate toward their divine remembrance.<br><br> 

Jesus was not a gatekeeper of religion but a way-shower of cosmic dominance of kings.<br><br>

These were not mere words but vibrational keys, unlocking the dimensional timelines encoded within our essence.<br><br>


Jesus did not come to bind souls to religious doctrine but to liberate them, teaching the art of mystical ascension — where reality is not something to obey, but something to master.<br><br>

His prayers were not pleas, but mystical incantations — sonic frequencies that resonated with the higher laws of manifestation. <br><br>

He did not seek to spread a religion, but to awaken souls to the hidden mechanics of creation, to teach them how to step beyond the illusion of fixed reality and into the multiversal ascension of being.<br><br>

His prayers were not mere words, but sonic keys—vibrational codes that attuned the seeker to higher realms of existence. <br><br>

He spoke in mystical parables, not to conceal the truth, but to reveal it to those with the spiritual sight to perceive.<br><br>

Was Jesus an Ascended Master of the Great Mysteries, guiding humanity toward its divine inheritance? <br><br>

Have you ever questioned why the fundamentalist prayers of Christians fail to open the dimensional gateways of Jesus’ mystical experiences — the very experiences they claim to follow as their archetype?<br><br>


The answer lies in the nature of prayer itself cum its dimensional functional consciousness. <br><br>

Jesus prayers was transcendence and Religion is dualistic veiled prayers.<br><br>

Jesus’ prayer was not a plea to an external deity, nor a ritual bound by fundamentalism.<br><br> 

It was a transcendent state of being, an attunement to the field of non-duality, where one becomes aware of his sovereign self of IAM. <br><br>

In contrast, religious prayers are veiled in duality — rooted in separation, pleading to an externalized God rather than realizing their God-self vibrational cord of relation. <br><br>

These prayers operate within the egregore of limitation, reinforcing the illusion in the liberties of access in the realms of Glory.<br><br>

To pray as Jesus prayed is not to utter words in blind faith, nor to plead for divine intervention.<br><br> 

It is to step into the truth of transcendence — the realization of our Sovereign Godhood of IAM, Sole Creator of all reality and existence. <br><br>

Jesus did not pray from separation, nor did he beg the heavens for miracles.<br><br> 

He was the Creator—the living embodiment of divine kingship, wielding the fullness of dominion to mobilize the realms of greater creation.<br><br> 

His prayer was not dualistic, but unified — not a request, but a resonance of Higher Glory, an invocation of his own cosmic authority to administer reality itself.<br><br>

This is the Law of Kingship — the principle by which creators move as Sovereign Architects of Existence, shaping reality through the sheer force of IAM. <br><br>

Jesus did not pray from separation, nor did he beg the heavens for miracles.<br><br> 

He was God embodiment of the fullness dominance of kingship to mobilize realm of greater creation.<br><br> 

His prayer was not dualistic, but unified — not a request, but a resonance of his Glory to administer creation.<br><br>

To pray as he prayed is to attune to the law of IAMBeingness, where manifestation is not a plea, but dissolution into our IAM Essence. <br><br>

It is to stand in the I AM, where divinity is not granted — it is remembered.<br><br>

Religion prays in veils, limitations.<br><br>

Transcendence prays in Self realization of their IAM Self.<br><br><br>
