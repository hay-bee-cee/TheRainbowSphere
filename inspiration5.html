        <b style="font-size: 20px;">"THE STRENGTH OF HER BOUNDARIES"/b>
            

            She is not cruel—she is clear,
            Not cold—just fiercely sincere.
            Her love is deep, but it is wise,
            Not built on sacrifice or lies.
            
            You call it harsh, you call it mean,
            But only because you’ve never seen
            A woman rise in sovereign grace,
            Refusing to be misplaced.
            
            She does not bend, she does not break,
            She’s learned the toll that takers take.
            So now she stands, unshaken, free,
            Unmoved by false humility.
            
            A privilege lost was never yours,
            No right to walk through open doors.
            Love does not demand or steal,
            It does not cage, it does not kneel.
            
            To push, to pry, to claim her space—
            That is not love, that is disgrace.
            For love is trust, and love is choice,
            And hers still roars in her own voice.
            
            So let her rise, let her be,
            Bounded not by shame, but free.
            For love protects, and love defends—
            And she has found her love again.
