            She is not cruel—she is clear,<br>
            Not cold—just fiercely sincere.<br>
            Her love is deep, but it is wise,<br>
            Not built on sacrifice or lies.<br><br><br>
            
            You call it harsh, you call it mean,<br>
            But only because you’ve never seen<br>
            A woman rise in sovereign grace,<br>
            Refusing to be misplaced.<br><br><br>
            
            She does not bend, she does not break,<br>
            She’s learned the toll that takers take.<br>
            So now she stands, unshaken, free,<br>
            Unmoved by false humility.<br><br><br>
            
            A privilege lost was never yours,<br>
            No right to walk through open doors.<br>
            Love does not demand or steal,<br>
            It does not cage, it does not kneel.<br><br><br>
            
            To push, to pry, to claim her space—<br>
            That is not love, that is disgrace.<br>
            For love is trust, and love is choice,<br>
            And hers still roars in her own voice.<br><br><br>
            
            So let her rise, let her be,<br>
            Bounded not by shame, but free.<br>
            For love protects, and love defends—<br>
            And she has found her love again.<br><br><br>
